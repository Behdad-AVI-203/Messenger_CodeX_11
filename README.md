# Messenger_CodeX
```
The present application is a co - project written by Mohammadreza Aldaghi & Behdad Anvari,
students of Computer engineering in Isfahan University of Technology.
In this application the authors have used C++ language based on Qt framework.
The handling of the project is carried out through APIs which is written by TAs groups.
These APIs are actually the commands which are processed in the application and development groups have implemented them.
Features & Capabilities:
1. Taking back-ups and installers
2. The data could be accessed by the user even when there is no connection to internet.
3. Simple but comprehensive user interface
4. The application would not be stopped even if the back-up servers encounter an accidental problem
Finally, the authors acknowledge that the application is a student project.
It requires to be developed by powerful servers in future.
The goal of the group is to promote the coding system and security of the application.
For the purpose of upgrading security, the authors are hopeful that through applying face
identification technology and especially iris scanning, they will endeavor a vital step
in developing this application to the extent that the project will be developed from
only a student project to a useful and easy workable application for other students of our country.
